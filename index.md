# Welcome to my Website!

I am a rising senior at Amherst College majoring in Mathematics and Music looking to pursue Biostatistics as a career. I am currently interested in statistical methodology in clinical trials, causal inference, and statistics pedagogy. 

My current *theoretical* research is revolved around developing a new multiple imputation (MI) technique for continuous bounded outcomes, including limit-of-detection (LOD) data. My current *applied* research concerns using multiple mediation analysis in explaining quantitative achivement gaps between different demographics of college students. 

I am also a Statistics and Data Science (SDS) Fellow at Amherst College, where I help over 150 students a semester on material from Introductory Statistics, Intermediate Statistics, and Data Science.

My website includes [a link to my CV](page1) and [reflections for some self-studying that I have done](page2), with a page for publications and major projects (pending).

In my spare time, I am an avid artist. My first passion was clarinet performance, and now I am learning opera voice. I am also a photographer and an amateur home cook. [You can check out some snippits of my art here](page3). I also love exploring nature reserves and new places. Here is a map of countries and US states I have lived in / visited.
