# Welcome to My GitHub Page

My name is Daniel Jang. I am a rising senior at Amherst College majoring in Mathematics and Music looking to pursue Biostatistics as a career. I am currently interested in statistical methodology in clinical trials, causal inference, and statistics pedagogy. 

My current theoretical research is revolved around developing a new multiple imputation (MI) technique for continuous bounded outcomes, including limit-of-detection (LOD) data. My current applied research concerns using multiple mediation analysis in explaining quantitative achivement gaps between different demographics of college students. I am also a Statistics and Data Science (SDS) Fellow at Amherst College, where I help over 150 students a semester on material from Introductory Statistics, Intermediate Statistics, and Data Science.

My website includes a page for , [a link to my updated CV](page2), and [some self-studying that I have done in the format of a blog so anyone can challenge me](page1)

In my spare time, I am an avid artist. My first passion was clarinet performance, and now I am learning opera voice. I am also a photographer and an amateur home cook. You can check out [some snippits of my art here](page3). I also love exploring nature reserves and new cities.
