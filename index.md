# Welcome to my Website!

I am a rising senior at Amherst College majoring in Mathematics and Music looking to pursue Biostatistics as a career. I am currently interested in statistical methodology in causal inference, clinical trials, and statistics pedagogy. 

I am currently pursuing two *methodological* projects. The first is affiliated with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in New York City concerning measurement errors in stratified randomization. The second is affiliated with The Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, revolved around developing a new multiple imputation (MI) method for continuous and bounded variables with moderate to heavy skew. My current *applied* research concerns using multiple mediation analysis to better understand what factors affect quantitative achivement gaps between historically privileged and marganlized groups of college students. 

I am also a Statistics and Data Science (SDS) Fellow at Amherst College, where I help over 150 students a semester on material from the three foundational courses (Introductory: 135, Intermediate: 230, and Data Science: 231). Additionally, I worked for the Office of Advancement on Alumni engagement, and I hope to pursue thesis consulting.

My website includes [a link to my CV](page1) and [reflections for some self-studying that I have done](page2), with a page for publications and major projects (pending).

In my spare time, I am an avid artist. My first passion was clarinet performance, and now I am learning opera voice. I am also a photographer and an amateur home cook. [You can check out some snippits of my art here](page3). I also love exploring nature reserves and new places.
